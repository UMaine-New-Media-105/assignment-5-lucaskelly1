Challenge One:
https://editor.p5js.org/lucaskelly/sketches/Wuh60opXh

This is a bubble simulation created using the p5.js library. The setup() function creates five bubbles with random positions and sizes, while the draw() function updates and displays them using the Bubble class. The Bubble class contains information about each bubble's position, size, and movement speed, and the move() method constrains the bubbles to stay within the canvas. The show() method displays the bubbles as ellipses with random colors and transparency. The program can be run in a web browser with p5.js installed.

Challenge Two:
https://editor.p5js.org/lucaskelly/sketches/Q8Ns3hT-X


This program uses p5.js to create a bubble simulation with randomly moving bubbles of different sizes and colors. The setup() function creates fifty bubbles with random positions and sizes, while the draw() function updates and displays them using the Bubble class. The Bubble class contains information about each bubble's position, size, and movement speed, and the move() method constrains the bubbles to stay within the canvas. The show() method displays the bubbles as ellipses with random colors and transparency. 
---------------------
Challenge Three: 
https://editor.p5js.org/lucaskelly/sketches/UP6K8ojGe

The code creates 50 bubbles, 50 donuts, and 50 squares with random positions, sizes, and speeds. The bubbles jitter randomly and are bounded within the canvas. The donuts move linearly, bounce off the edges of the canvas, and rotate. The squares move linearly, bounce off the edges of the canvas, and are always square-shaped. The code also updates and shows the objects on each frame.
----------------------
Challenge Four:
https://editor.p5js.org/lucaskelly/sketches/GvtBdWHBg

This program creates an animation with three types of objects: bubbles, donuts, and squares. Each type has 50 objects with random positions and sizes, and they move around the canvas with different speeds and behavior. Bubbles move randomly and slowly, donuts move in a circular motion, and squares move back and forth. The objects bounce off the edges of the canvas to stay within bounds. Unfortunatly, I was unable to make the breeders create others of its kind, after experimenting and trying to do so for quite a while.

Challenge 5:
https://editor.p5js.org/lucaskelly/sketches/84Ebdifbj

This program was supposed to make the catcher sprite destroy the breeder. Unfortunatly, I was unable to do so after not being able to do challenge four. Do do this, I should use collision detection. 
----------------------
P.S. The bubble function was changed to a triangle, but is named bubble.
